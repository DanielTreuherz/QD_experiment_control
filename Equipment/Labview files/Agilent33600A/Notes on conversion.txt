Notes on testing:
Array waveform format would be quite difficult to pass through labview to python - is this neccesary? Filepath should work.
The read error VI - is that ever used in actual experiments? I can pass it back to Labview easily.
A33ConfigureFM contains SOUR AM - is this a mistake? I think it would only effect things if using frequency modulation source that isn't the default. (Probably internal)
